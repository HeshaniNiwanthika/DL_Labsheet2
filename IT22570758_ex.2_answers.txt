* Increasing the model capacity helps to learn more complex algorithms.
   * Increasing the model capacity increases the computational cost.

2.* Adding more hidden nodes to a neural network initially increases accuracy because it gives the model enough capacity to learn complex patterns in the data, preventing underfitting, and allows it to correctly fit the non-linear shape of the dataset.


  * Increasing the number of hidden nodes can cause a model to overfit.
